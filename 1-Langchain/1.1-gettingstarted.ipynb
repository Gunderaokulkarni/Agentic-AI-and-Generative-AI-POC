      "Okay, I need to explain what LangSmith is. Let me start by recalling what I know about it. LangSmith is a platform related to machine learning and AI, probably focused on building and managing machine learning models. It's created by LangChain, which I know is a framework for building applications with large language models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, LangSmith probably offers tools to streamline the ML development process. Let me think about the key features. Maybe it includes experiment tracking, model management, and deployment? I remember hearing that it helps with tracking experiments, which is important for comparing different models and their performances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, there's also a component for data management. Cleaning and preparing data is a big part of ML, so LangSmith might offer tools for that. Also, model evaluation and testing. Maybe there's a way to automate hyperparameter tuning or perform A/B testing of models.\n",

      "\n",
      "I should also mention the specific tools LangSmith provides. Experiment tracking would allow users to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts. Data versioning for tracking different datasets. Model registry to store and manage trained models. Monitoring for model performance in production. Maybe a UI for these tasks as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I need to clarify the exact components. Let me make sure. Experiment tracking, model registry, data versioning, and deployment pipelines. Also, maybe tools for evaluating models and testing them against different datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there any specific use cases or industries where LangSmith is particularly useful? Probably a wide range since ML is used in many fields. But maybe they highlight applications in NLP, computer vision, or other domains where LangChain has expertise.\n",

      "I should also consider the target audience. Is LangSmith for data scientists, ML engineers, or both? It's likely designed for both roles, helping them collaborate and manage their projects more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to check if there are any unique features. For example, does it support MLOps practices? Maybe it integrates with CI/CD pipelines for model deployment. Or offers infrastructure as a service for training models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think LangSmith has a component called the \"Model Registry\" where users can store and manage different versions of their models. Also, a \"Data Registry\" for datasets. Experiment tracking logs training runs with hyperparameters, metrics, and other info.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UI probably allows users to visualize their experiments, compare models, and view metrics. Collaboration features like sharing experiments or models with team members.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention deployment and monitoring. How does LangSmith handle deploying models to production? Maybe through integrations with cloud services or containerization tools. Monitoring would involve tracking model performance over time and detecting data drift.\n",

It's a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without explicit programming. I should mention the main types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.\n\nWait, maybe I should also include some applications to make it more relatable. Like, ML is used in image recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. Oh, and maybe touch on the process involved—data collection, model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n\nI should keep it concise but cover the essentials. Also, the user wants a JSON object as the answer, so I need to structure it properly. Let me make sure the key points are clear and avoid technical jargon where possible. Let me check if I missed any important aspects. Oh, maybe mention that ML improves with experience over time. Yeah, that's a key point. Alright, let's put it all together in a structured JSON format.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions with minimal human intervention. Key types include: \\n\\n1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., classification, regression). \\n2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction). \\n3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns optimal actions through trial and error with rewards/penalties. \\n\\nApplications range from image recognition and recommendation systems to natural language processing and autonomous vehicles. ML systems improve over time as they are exposed to more data, making them adaptable and scalable for complex tasks.\"\n}\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",

Let me start by defining what ML is. It's a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without explicit programming. I should mention the main types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.\n\nWait, maybe I should also include some applications to make it more relatable. Like, ML is used in image recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. Oh, and maybe touch on the process involved—data collection, model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n\nI should keep it concise but cover the essentials. Also, the user wants a JSON object as the answer, so I need to structure it properly. Let me make sure the key points are clear and avoid technical jargon where possible. Let me check if I missed any important aspects. Oh, maybe mention that ML improves with experience over time. Yeah, that's a key point. Alright, let's put it all together in a structured JSON format.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions with minimal human intervention. Key types include: \\n\\n1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., classification, regression). \\n2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction). \\n3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns optimal actions through trial and error with rewards/penalties. \\n\\nApplications range from image recognition and recommendation systems to natural language processing and autonomous vehicles. ML systems improve over time as they are exposed to more data, making them adaptable and scalable for complex tasks.\"\n}\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE "

PolicyTutorialsBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templatesOn this pageBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templates\\nIn this quickstart we\\'ll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it\\'s just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!\\nAfter reading this tutorial, you\\'ll have a high level overview of:\\n\\n\\nUsing language models\\n\\n\\nUsing prompt templates\\n\\n\\nDebugging and tracing your application using LangSmith\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s dive in!\\nSetup\\u200b\\nJupyter Notebook\\u200b\\nThis and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebooks. Going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them. See here for instructions on how to install.\\nInstallation\\u200b\\nTo install LangChain run:\\n\\nPipCondapip install langchainconda install langchain -c conda-forge\\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\\nAs these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\\nThe best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nAfter you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"export LANGSMITH_PROJECT=\"default\" # or any other project name\\nOr, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\\nimport getpassimport ostry:    # load environment variables from .env file (requires `python-dotenv`)    from dotenv import load_dotenv    load_dotenv()except ImportError:    passos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"if \"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\" not in os.environ:    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(        prompt=\"Enter your LangSmith API key (optional): \"    )if \"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\" not in os.environ:    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"] = getpass.getpass(        prompt=\\'Enter your LangSmith Project Name (default = \"default\"): \\'    )    if not os.environ.get(\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"):        os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"] = \"default\"\\nUsing Language Models\\u200b\\nFirst up, let\\'s learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangeably. For details on getting started with a specific model, refer to supported integrations.\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect chat model:Google Gemini▾OpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle GeminiGoogle VertexAWSGroqCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIIBM watsonxDatabricksxAIPerplexitypip install -qU \"langchain[google-genai]\"import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for Google Gemini: \")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelmodel = init_chat_model(\"gemini-2.0-flash\", model_provider=\"google_genai\")\\nLet\\'s first use the model directly. ChatModels are instances of LangChain Runnables, which means they expose a standard interface for interacting with them. To simply call the model, we can pass in a list of messages to the .invoke method.\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessagemessages = [    SystemMessage(\"Translate the following from English into Italian\"),    HumanMessage(\"hi!\"),]model.invoke(messages)API Reference:HumanMessage | SystemMessage\\nAIMessage(content=\\'Ciao!\\', additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 3, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 20, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-32654a56-627c-40e1-a141-ad9350bbfd3e-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 20, \\'output_tokens\\': 3, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\ntipIf we\\'ve enabled LangSmith, we can see that this run is logged to LangSmith, and can see the LangSmith trace. The LangSmith trace reports token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nNote that ChatModels receive message objects as input and generate message objects as output. In addition to text content, message objects convey conversational roles and hold important data, such as tool calls and token usage counts.\\nLangChain also supports chat model inputs via strings or OpenAI format. The following are equivalent:\\nmodel.invoke(\"Hello\")model.invoke([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}])model.invoke([HumanMessage(\"Hello\")])\\nStreaming\\u200b\\nBecause chat models are Runnables, they expose a standard interface that includes async and streaming modes of invocation. This allows us to stream individual tokens from a chat model:\\nfor token in model.stream(messages):    print(token.content, end=\"|\")\\n|C|iao|!||\\nYou can find more details on streaming chat model outputs in this guide.\\nPrompt Templates\\u200b\\nRight now we are passing a list of messages directly into the language model. Where does this list of messages come from? Usually, it is constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template with the user input.\\nPrompt templates are a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this transformation. They take in raw user input and return data (a prompt) that is ready to pass into a language model.\\nLet\\'s create a prompt template here. It will take in two user variables:\\n\\nlanguage: The language to translate text into\\ntext: The text to translate\\n\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem_template = \"Translate the following from English into {language}\"prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [(\"system\", system_template), (\"user\", \"{text}\")])API Reference:ChatPromptTemplate\\nNote that ChatPromptTemplate supports multiple message roles in a single template. We format the language parameter into the system message, and the user text into a user message.\\nThe input to this prompt template is a dictionary. We can play around with this prompt template by itself to see what it does by itself\\nprompt = prompt_template.invoke({\"language\": \"Italian\", \"text\": \"hi!\"})prompt\\nChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})])\\nWe can see that it returns a ChatPromptValue that consists of two messages. If we want to access the messages directly we do:\\nprompt.to_messages()\\n[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\\nFinally, we can invoke the chat model on the formatted prompt:\\nresponse = model.invoke(prompt)print(response.content)\\nCiao!\\ntipMessage content can contain both text and content blocks with additional structure. See this guide for more information.\\nIf we take a look at the LangSmith trace, we can see exactly what prompt the chat model receives, along with token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nConclusion\\u200b\\nThat\\'s it! In this tutorial you\\'ve learned how to create your first simple LLM application. You\\'ve learned how to work with language models, how to create a prompt template, and how to get great observability into applications you create with LangSmith.\\nThis just scratches the surface of what you will want to learn to become a proficient AI Engineer.
